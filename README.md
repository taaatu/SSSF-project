# Item renting app

This is the Server-side Scripting Frameworks course project. The task was to develop a GraphQL backend with Node.js and build a frontend with preferred framework. 
I decided to make an item renting app which users can use to rent their items to others.

## App features
#### Users can:
- add their own items
  - Delete and modify
- review other's items
- send rent requests for items
- delete their user accounts
#### Admin can:
- delete and modify all items
#### Done after final presentation
- Users can respond to received rent requests
  - Accept / Decline
- Users can delete the rent requests that are still pending
- User profile page
  - Sent and received rent requests and own items

## Getting started

- clone repo:
`git clone https://github.com/taaatu/SSSF-project.git`
- install dependencies: `npm i && cd client && npm i`
- create two `.env` files. One in root and another to client folder
  - based on the `.env.exampe` files
